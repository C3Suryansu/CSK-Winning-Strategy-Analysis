# CSK-Winning-Strategy-Analysis

CSK is one of the strongest teams of IPL, but what's the secret behind their success?

- Is it the strenght of the players?
- Or is it the management who picks the players from the auction?
- Or is it the captain's strategy?

We used the data from IPL's auction, and each play's data, outsourced from Kaggle, and used the power of Tableau to find patterns and understand the strategy behind CSK's success.
